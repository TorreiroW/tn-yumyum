This recipe is for plain naans, but don't let that stop you from adding garlic butter!

## Preparation:

1.	Place the flour in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and add 2 tablespoons of oil, yogurt, yeast, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Mix everything with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Gradually add the warm milk, mixing everything together until it forms a cohesive dough.
2.	Transfer the dough onto a clean, floured work surface. It may be sticky at first, soft yet heavy. Knead the dough for 5 minutes, expect messy hands ðŸ˜‰ and coat the dough all around with 1 teaspoon of oil.
3.	Place the dough in a bowl large enough to allow it to double in size. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise for at least 1 hour in a warm place.
4.	Once the dough has doubled in volume, divide it into 12 pieces. Roll each piece between your palms to form a small ball. Dust the ball with flour and roll it out into a thin round shape.
5.	Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and place a naan in the pan once it's hot. Flip the naan when bubbles start to form - around 20 to 30 seconds - using a spatula, and cook the other side for the same amount of time. Check regularly to prevent burning. Flip the naan again and gently press it against the pan for 10 to 15 seconds. If it puffs up, that's fantastic; it means the naan is soft inside. Flip it again and cook for an additional 10 to 15 seconds. Ensure there are no raw spots, then remove the naan from the pan. Cook the remaining dough in the same manner.
6.	Stack the naans to keep them warm and cover them with aluminum foil.


### Enjoy your naan!
