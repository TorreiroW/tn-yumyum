- Preheat the oven to 180 degrees. 
- Remove the puff pastry sheets from the freezer and let them come to room temperature. 
- Meanwhile, cut the bell pepper into cubes and finely chop the garlic. 
- Pour a very small dash of oil into a frying pan and let the spinach wilt over a low heat. 
- Once it has shrunk squeeze out the liquid from the spinach using, for example, a sieve.
- Fry the bell pepper and garlic for another minute. 
- Beat the eggs together with the cream and mix in the herbs. 
- Grease a spring form or baking dish with a little oil and then cover with the puff pastry slices. 
- Divide the ham cubes and the contents of the snack pan over the puff pastry.

- Pour the egg mixture on top and sprinkle the top with grated cheese. 
- Put the savory pie with spinach and ham in the oven for about 30-35 minutes

## Enjoy your meal!
