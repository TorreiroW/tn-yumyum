An easy and delicious meal! 

## Preparation:

1. Drain the tofu, wrap it in kitchen paper, and place something heavy on top to press out the moisture. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes. Mix the dark soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, ginger root, sriracha, sesame oil and garlic together in a large bowl.
2. Remove the kitchen paper and cut the tofu into eight equal slices. Place them in the marinade and let them marinate for at least 30 minutes. For optimal flavor, you can marinate them overnight.
3. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit). Place the tofu slices in a baking dish and spoon half of the marinade over the slices. After 15 minutes, flip the tofu, add the broccoli, and pour the remaining marinade over them. Put everything back in the oven for another 15 minutes. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top before serving. For those with bigger appetites, you can also add rice.


### Enjoy your meal!
