A hearty one-pot dish packed with flavor. 

## Preparation:

1.	Finely chop the onion and garlic. Heat oil in a pan and sauté the onion for about 5 minutes over medium heat.
2.	Add the garlic and sauté briefly.
3.	Dice the sweet potatoes and add them to the pan along with the spices and salt. Sauté them well.
4.	Rinse the red lentils and add them to the pan along with the diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Add half a can of water and add more if the stew becomes too dry. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let the stew simmer for about 15 minutes until the sweet potatoes and lentils are cooked. Stir regularly.
5.	Add the peas to the stew and cook for an additional two minutes.
6.	Garnish the stew with olives and freshly chopped parsley.


### Enjoy your meal!
