A delicious comfort soup with a lot of veggies, herbs, and spices.

## Preparation:

1. Heat 2 tablespoons of ghee in a soup pot. Sauté the chopped onions and garlic. 
2. Finely chop the dried chili peppers. Add them to the pot along with the cumin seeds, crushed coriander seeds, mustard seeds, turmeric, and madras curry powder. Sauté for a moment. Add the cinnamon stick and grated fresh ginger. Sauté briefly. 
3. Rinse the lentils. Wash and cut the celery, carrots, and tomatoes into pieces. Peel the apple and cut it into small cubes. Sauté the vegetables and apple for a moment. Add the lentils. 
4. Add the vegetable broth and coconut milk. Bring the soup to a boil. Reduce the heat and let the soup simmer for about half an hour until the lentils are cooked. Taste and season the soup with salt and pepper. With an immersion blender, you puree the soup until it is smooth.  
5. Garnish the soup with fresh coriander. 

And if you would like, you can stirr in some leftover rice in your soup. Otherwise, a freshly baked naan does the trick as well. Recipe can be found [here](https://wearetechnative.github.io/yumyum/recipe/naan-bread-v1/)


### Enjoy your meal!
