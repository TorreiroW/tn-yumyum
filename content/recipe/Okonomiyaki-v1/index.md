A Japanese streetfood dish

## Preparation:

1. Whisk the eggs in a bowl. Add the flour and whisk until you have a smooth batter. 
2. Add the soy sauce, ginger, Chinese cabbage, bean sprouts, spring onion, garlic, and carrot to the batter. Stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.  
3. Heat a little rice oil in a frying pan. Pour half of the batter into the pan and cook the omelette on both sides until cooked through and golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter to make two pancakes. 
4. Top the pancakes with furikake and/or sesame seeds, and drizzle with Japanese mayonnaise. 

### Enjoy your meal!
